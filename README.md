### 🎯 Why This Matters to Me

Harvard’s CS50 courses are known for their **rigor and clarity**, and diving into them has been a powerful way to strengthen my foundation in **computer science and programming**.

But this repository is about more than just course completion.  
It’s where I:

- 💥 **Challenge myself**
- 🤔 Make mistakes and learn from them
- 💡 Celebrate every “aha!” moment
- 🔄 Build consistent, real progress

> **"It’s not just about finishing a course — it’s about becoming a better problem solver, thinker, and creator, one line of code at a time."** 💻🧩

Thanks for stopping by! 🙌 Feel free to explore the folders, reach out, or follow my progress.
