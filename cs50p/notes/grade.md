## ðŸ§  Exercise Summary

This program reads a numeric score from the user and prints a corresponding letter grade based on standard grading thresholds.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Code Analyzed

```python
score = int(input("Score: "))

if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80 and score < 90:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70 and score < 80:
    print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60 and score < 70:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```
## ðŸ§¾ Alternative Version (Pythonic Comparison)

```python
if 90 <= score <= 100:
    print("Grade: A")
elif 80 <= score < 90:
    print("Grade: B")
elif 70 <= score < 80:
    print("Grade: C")
elif 60 <= score < 70:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

## ðŸ§¾ Alternative Version (Simplified Threshold Logic)

```python
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
